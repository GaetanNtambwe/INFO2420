	some other scheme? NO scheme?)</li>
	<li>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?</li>

it? Why?</li>

navigation well done?</li>

<h3>Web site: http://www.traderjoes.com/ Traderjoe's</h3>
	<p> My first impression of the Traderjoe's website is that there is too much information at once, which confused me a little at first.
	However ,I later found a list, or ribbon on the left that separated each section of the website for a better navigation</p>
	<p>the site structure make sense to me,because the information shared on the website focuses on their products, discoveries, and recipes 
	that people may be interested,organized from the most important to the least important. Regarding the graphics, the graphics used in the website,
	illustrated the meaning of their market, which is based on farms.</p>
	<p> The load time is reasonable for me,and the text color and size are readable and reasonable.The background-color design allows for easy readibility of page.</p>
	<p>About the navigation bar, the site include oone, and the tool is well done. The web page uses a consistent a color scheme accross different pages.</p>
	<p>The site responds well to smaller window sizes. The elements resize and stack appropriately, making it usable on tablets and phones.</p>
	<p> One unusualbut well done aspect of the site is that it intentionally avoids online shopping instead of supports in the store experience.
	Overall, the website look good to navigate</p>
